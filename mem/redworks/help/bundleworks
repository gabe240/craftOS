BundleWorks is a Redworks program that tells the computer which redpower wire attached to a bundled cable to activate / deactivate. All you have to do is type the color you wish to toggle the output.
 
 colors such as: supports all 16 colors: White, Orange, Magenta, LightBlue, Yellow, Lime, Pink, Gray, LightGray, Cyan, Purple, Blue, Brown, Green, Yellow, and Black.
 
 reset: turns all the wires off.
 all: turns all the wires on.
 quit: quits the program, and shutdown.
 
 Important: Bundleworks assumes you have the regular 
 bundled cable, connected to the back of the computer for output. And the extension of color wire you choose.]]
