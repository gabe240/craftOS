GameAPI is a lightweight and easy to use library that you can use to make games.
The library uses a system of automatically drawn and bounded actors and it does most of the work that you would have to normally do yourself.
Because of the graphical limitations of CraftOS, the interface is in an ascii-type style, a text character representing each actor.
