Snowfall is an element in the game. Much like rain, it is a type of weather. It currently exists in the full version of the game. 
Behavior: Snowfall happens occasionally and will only fall in the Tundra biome and causes water that does not have a block above it to become ice, as well as gradually covering all blocks in snow with the exception of transparent blocks. Snowfall will happen at the same time as rain is falling. If you are between a biome that produces rain and another that produces snow, you can see both snow and rain.
Trivia: If it is snowing and you go to sleep it will most likely have stopped before you wake. 
When it rains, it also snows in different biomes, despite the fact that the effects of each are not similar. (Snowfall generating snow/re-frosting ice, and rainfall causing thunderstorms from time to time. 
History: Snowfall was reintroduced in Beta 1.5 after having been removed during Alpha with the Halloween Update.
